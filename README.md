# DxfGenerator

DxfGenerator is a specialized project designed to fulfill the specific requirements of Planetfan, a company that deals with fan manufacturing (https://planetfan.pl/). The purpose of DxfGenerator is to generate CAD DXF files for nameplates that are attached to the fans. The data required for the nameplates is stored in an Excel spreadsheet, and the program retrieves the necessary information from the spreadsheet.

Once the data is collected, DxfGenerator creates a DXF file that can be used with Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software. This software is then utilized to generate toolpaths that are necessary for mechanical milling machines to engrave the nameplates onto the fans.

In summary, DxfGenerator is a software tool that helps Planetfan automate the process of generating nameplates for its fans by extracting data from an Excel spreadsheet and converting it into a DXF file that can be used by CAM software and mechanical milling machines for engraving.
